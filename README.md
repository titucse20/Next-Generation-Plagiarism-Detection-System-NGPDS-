# Course Code: CSE 305
# Course Title: Software Engineering
# Project Proposal: Next-Generation Plagiarism Detection System (NGPDS).
# Introduction: 

Developing a Next-Generation Plagiarism Detection System (NGPDS) App using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model involves several phases. SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining an information system. Here's a simplified guide using the traditional Waterfall SDLC model. Keep in mind that real-world projects often use Agile methodologies for flexibility.

# Steps of Waterfall model:

## 1.Requirement Gathering and analysis:

* Work closely with educational professionals and stakeholders to gather detailed requirements for the app.

* Define the features and functionalities needed for online plagiarism cross-match services.

## 2. System Design:
* Develop a system architecture for the Next-Generation Plagiarism Detection System.

* Create detailed technical specifications for the app.

* Design the database schema.

* Plan for the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

## 3. Implementation:
* Write code for the Next-Generation Plagiarism Detection System.

* Develop the mobile application for Android and/or iOS.

* Integrate the app with necessary sensors (e.g., camera).

* Implement the backend server for processing and storing data.

## 4. Testing:
* Perform unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.

* Conduct integration testing to verify that all components work together.

* Carry out system testing to evaluate the app as a whole.

* Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

## 5. Deployment:
* Prepare for the app launch by configuring servers and databases.

* Deploy the app to relevant platforms (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

* Monitor the app's performance and address any issues that arise.

## 6. Maintenance and Support:
* Address any post-launch issues or bugs promptly.

* Gather user feedback for future updates and improvements.

* Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the app.
